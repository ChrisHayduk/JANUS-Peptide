# Results Folder
All results from running JANUS will be stored here. 
The following files will be created: 

1. fitness_explore.txt: 
   Fitness values for all molecules from the exploration component of JANUS. 
   
2. fitness_local_search.txt: 
   Fitness values for all molecules from the exploitation component of JANUS. 

3. generation_all_best.txt: 
   Smiles and fitness value for the best molecule encountered in every generation (iteration). 

4. init_mols.txt: 
   List of molecules used to initialte JANUS. 

5. population_explore.txt: 
   SMILES for all molecules from the exploration component of JANUS. 

6. population_local_search.txt:
